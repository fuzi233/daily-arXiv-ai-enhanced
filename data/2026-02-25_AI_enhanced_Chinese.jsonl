Their joint predictive structure at the population level remains incompletely characterized. Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup equity of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Data and Methods: We analyze 18,792 children aged 10-17 years from the 2021 National Survey of Children's Health. Overweight/obesity is defined using BMI categories. Predictors included diet, physical activity, sleep, parental stress, socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences, and neighborhood characteristics. Models include logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, multilayer perceptron, and TabNet. Performance is evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Brier score. Results: Discrimination range from 0.66 to 0.79. Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and MLP showed the most stable balance of discrimination and calibration. Boosting and deep learning modestly improve recall and F1 score. No model was uniformly superior. Performance disparities across race and poverty groups persist across algorithms. Conclusion: Increased model complexity yields limited gains over logistic regression. Predictors consistently span behavioral, household, and neighborhood domains. Persistent subgroup disparities indicate the need for improved data quality and equity-focused surveillance rather than greater algorithmic complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset.

We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring.

But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems.

This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity.

Analysing KG exploration interfaces at the level of interaction primitives, we suggest that many systems rely on epistemic assumptions that do not hold at first contact. This reveals a structural gap in the design space: the absence of interaction primitives for scope revelation, mechanisms that communicate what a KG contains without requiring users to formulate queries or interpret ontological structures.

Within the allowed timeframe of the challenge, Aletheia autonomously solved 6 problems (2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of 10 according to majority expert assessments; we note that experts were not unanimous on Problem 8 (only). For full transparency, we explain our interpretation of FirstProof and disclose details about our experiments as well as our evaluation.

Traditional methods often rely on statistical analyses or role-based simulations but face challenges with multiple allegations, diverse evidence, and lack adaptability. In this paper, we introduce JurisMMA, a novel framework for LJP that effectively decomposes trial tasks, standardizes processes, and organizes them into distinct stages. Furthermore, we build JurisMM, a large dataset with over 100,000 recent Chinese judicial records, including both text and multimodal video-text data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on JurisMM and the benchmark LawBench validate our framework's effectiveness. These results indicate that our framework is effective not only for LJP but also for a broader range of legal applications, offering new perspectives for the development of future legal methods and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
