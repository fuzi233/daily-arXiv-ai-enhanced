Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u4f18\u5316LLM\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728OUD/CP\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6162\u6027\u75bc\u75db\u4e0e\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u969c\u788d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9488\u5bf9\u63a5\u53d7MOUD\u6cbb\u7597\u8005\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7ba1\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6709\u671b\u8f85\u52a9\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u586b\u8865LLM\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7f\u6234\u6570\u636e\u5728\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bLLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08>0.7\uff09\uff0cLLM\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\u76f8\u5173\u6d1e\u5bdf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u963f\u7247\u590d\u53d1\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u63d0\u5347MOUD\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u53ca\u6162\u6027\u75bc\u75db\u4e0eOUD\u6574\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u75bc\u75db\u6fc0\u589e\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347OUD/CP\u60a3\u8005\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments.

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u8ba9\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u9759\u6001\u6216\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u9ed1\u76d2\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u96f6\u6563\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u7ef4\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u53cd\u8fc7\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5177\u5907\u6307\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30-\u6307\u5f15\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $\u03c9$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684RL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u5bb9\u9519\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u8fbe\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5956\u52b1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08reward hacking\uff09\u5229\u7528\u3002\u867d\u7136\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u901a\u8fc7$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u8861\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u8fd8\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u5b89\u5168-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bb9\u5fcd\u4e00\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6ee1\u8db3$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u9608\u503c\u5185\u6ee1\u8db3$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5230\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6781\u9650\u5e73\u5747\uff08limit-average\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff08$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5411\u6781\u9650\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06$\u03c9$-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRL\uff08\u5956\u52b1\u578b\u4e0e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6982\u7387\u578b\uff09\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u578bRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u6d32\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e26\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6587\u672c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u585e\u4f69\u8fea\u8bed\u548c\u585e\u8328\u74e6\u7eb3\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6765\u81eaSAfriSenti\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a66%\uff0c\u585e\u4f69\u8fea\u8bed\u4e3a69%\uff0c\u585e\u8328\u74e6\u7eb3\u8bed\u4e3a63%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u670934%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u8981\u540e\u7eed\u4eba\u5de5\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u7a00\u7f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "PersonaPulse\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u8868\u8fbe\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8bf1\u53d1LLMs\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4eba\u683c\u8868\u8fbe\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u683c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e0d\u591f\u5145\u5206\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u7ec6\u81f4\u8c03\u63a7LLMs\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPersonaPulse\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5bf9\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u60c5\u5883\u54cd\u5e94\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4eba\u683c\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "PersonaPulse\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u4eba\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u6b62\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u63a7\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PersonaPulse\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u4f7f\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u66f4\u52a0\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u6027AI\u4ea4\u4e92\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.\n  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u6863\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5f3a\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u53ca\u75c5\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u65e2\u8017\u65f6\u53c8\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u6b64\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0bLLM\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528MEDEC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e5d\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT\u3001Claude\u3001Gemini\u53caOpenAI o\u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u9879\u533b\u5b66\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u53e5\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002\u5206\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u9759\u6001\u968f\u673a\u4e3e\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u548cROUGE-1\u3001BLEURT\u3001BERTScore\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7ea0\u9519\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u504f\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6613\u6f0f\u68c0\u7f29\u7565\u8bed\u6216\u975e\u5178\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9759\u6001\u968f\u673a\u4f8b\u5b50\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5728\u5168\u90e8\u4e5d\u79cdLLM\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff08\u7ea615%\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9519\u8bef\u53e5\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff085-10%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff08RDP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff08zero-shot prompting\uff09\u548c\u9759\u6001\u968f\u673a\u4e3e\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\uff08SPR\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u6863\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments.

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption.

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

Code available at https://github.com/mihirs-0/synass", "summary": "Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u4f55\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u5411\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Transformer\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u52a3\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u8bed\u6599\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524dTransformer\u7406\u8bba\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5982LLM\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u201c\u9006\u5e8f\u8bc5\u5492\u201d\uff0c\u7a76\u7adf\u662f\u7531\u6570\u636e\u504f\u7f6e\u8fd8\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u672a\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4e00\u5207\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7eaf\u7cb9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67b6\u6784\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u71b5\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6620\u5c04\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u524d\u5411\uff08\u71b5\u4e3a\u96f6\uff09\u548c\u9006\u5411\uff08\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u4e0b\u754c\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GPT-2\u548cMLP\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5404\u79cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548cLoRA\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "GPT-2\u7b49\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u4e45\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u635f\u5931\u52a3\u52bf\uff08\u5982K=5\u65f6\u4e3a1.16\u7eb3\u7279\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7MLP\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0eLoRA\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u5185\u5728\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u6599\u7279\u6027\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u5f7b\u5e95\u5265\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u9006\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u201c\u6469\u64e6\u201d\u3002\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u7531\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u504f\u7f6e\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9891\u7387\u6216\u8bed\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u6240\u81f4\u3002"}}

However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems.

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "M$^3$Prune \u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 token \u5f00\u9500\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d token \u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u5c42\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9010\u6b65\u5197\u4f59\u8fb9\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cM$^3$Prune \u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 token \u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "M$^3$Prune \u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11 token \u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization.

However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation.

To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks.

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSSA\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6SSA\uff08Sparse Sparse Attention\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u53c8\u663e\u5f0f\u9f13\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "SSA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53ef\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u66f4\u591atoken\u53c2\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u610f\u5916\u6548\u679c\uff0cSSA\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SSA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Addressing the limitations of predominantly monolingual and single-label emotion corpora \\textcolor{black}{that restrict linguistic diversity, are unable to model mixed emotions, and lack ecological validity}, EM2LDL comprises expressive utterances in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, capturing the intra-utterance code-switching prevalent in multilingual regions like Hong Kong and Macao. The corpus integrates spontaneous emotional expressions from online platforms, annotated with fine-grained emotion distributions across 32 categories. Experimental baselines using self-supervised learning models demonstrate robust performance in speaker-independent gender-, age-, and personality-based evaluations, with HuBERT-large-EN achieving optimal results. By incorporating linguistic diversity and ecological validity, EM2LDL enables the exploration of complex emotional dynamics in multilingual settings.

Approaches to Grammatical Error Correction in Low-Resource Settings", "comment": "10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables; Accept-demonstration at BHASHA Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025", "summary": "Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC.

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements.

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "REFLEX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u51b3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u53cc\u91cd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u6838\u67e5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5a01\u80c1\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5224\u51b3\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aREFLEX\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u201csteering vectors\u201d\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5224\u51b3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "REFLEX\u5728\u4ec5\u7528465\u6761\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5237\u65b0\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u6838\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684SOTA\uff0c\u4e14\u201c\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u6807\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u8fbe7.57%\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u5907\u8be0\u91ca\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "REFLEX\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u51b3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5185\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models.

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios.

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u51c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5df2\u77e5\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8868\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u6355\u6349\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u4eba\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u6545\u4e8b\u7c7b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u5c42\uff08\u4e2d\u4e0a\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u8865\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f85\u52a9\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u5219\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\u5316\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u540c\u3002"}}

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528SES\u3001MPD\u3001ANLD\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8003\u5bdf\u8bcd\u5e72\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u533a\u5206\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0Bangla\u8bcd\u5e72\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u800c\u82f1\u6587\u7684Snowball\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff08SES\uff09\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff08MPD\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bcd\u5e72\u4e0e\u539f\u8bcd\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08ANLD\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790BNLTK\uff08\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\uff09\u548cSnowball\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002", "result": "BNLTK\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u867d\u7136\u5728SES\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5728ANLD\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9ad8SES\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u800cSnowball\u5728\u8bcd\u5e72\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u662f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6316\u6398\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u4f24\u6709\u663e\u8457\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faVibraVerse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cCLASP\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u58f0\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u6750\u6599\u3001\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7269\u7406\u94fe\u8def\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u4e25\u683c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaVibraVerse\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b3D\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6768\u6c0f\u6a21\u91cf\u3001\u6cca\u677e\u6bd4\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u9891\u7387\u3001\u632f\u578b\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u649e\u51fb\u58f0\u97f3\u30022. \u63d0\u51faCLASP\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u6837\u672c\u6765\u6e90\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7edf\u4e00\uff08\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u58f0\u97f3\uff09\u30023. \u5b9a\u4e49\u51e0\u4f55\u5230\u58f0\u97f3\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u58f0\u97f3\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "VibraVerse\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6CLASP\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u58f0\u97f3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u611f\u77e5\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "VibraVerse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53caCLASP\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863D\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
