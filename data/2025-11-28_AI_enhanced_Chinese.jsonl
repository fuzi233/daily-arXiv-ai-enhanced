We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u59828-puzzle\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6613\u9519\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75288-puzzle\u7ecf\u5178\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u8003\u5bdf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Zero-Shot\u3001Chain-of-Thought\u3001Algorithm-of-Thought\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u7ea7\u7ea0\u9519\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u6821\u9a8c\u5668\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u53ea\u80fd\u4f5c\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b-\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f83\u957f\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u95f4\u63a5\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4ec5\u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u6548\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6821\u9a8c\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u9898\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5e38\u4f5c\u51fa\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fdb\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u6216\u4f5c\u51fa\u4e0d\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u6536\u655b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u501f\u52a9\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u201c\u6280\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u6377\u5f84\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u867d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u521d\u6b65\u8bc6\u522b\u90e8\u5206\u201c\u6280\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5206\u6790\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4fe1\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u805a\u5408token\u5373\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u5df2\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure.

In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy.

We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools.

Bach"], "title": "Revisiting Generalization Across Difficulty Levels: It's Not So Easy", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5f88\u96be\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u6240\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5fc5\u987b\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u201c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u201d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u7684\u96be\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u660e\u786eLLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9009\u53d6\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u5343\u79cdLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6d4b\u8bc4\u9886\u57df\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff08IRT\uff09\u5bf9\u9898\u76ee\u96be\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6392\u9664\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u66f4\u4e3a\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u5206\u6790LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u96be\u6613\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u201c\u8de8\u96be\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u201d\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4ec5\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u2014\u2014\u5fc5\u987b\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u5927\u3002\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u96be\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5747\u9700\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
