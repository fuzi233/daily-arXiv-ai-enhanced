### [1] [Democratizing LLM Efficiency: From Hyperscale Optimizations to Universal Deployability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20662)
*Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有LLM效率方案只利于大公司，作者倡议发展适用于普通机构的低成本高效技术，推动公平和可持续应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效方法如MoE、投机解码、复杂的RAG，仅在大型科技公司配备顶级资源和团队的背景下才能带来收益，中小组织（如医院、学校等）难以采用，反而产生额外开销，造成不公平和碳排放浪费。

Method: 提出一个新的研究路线：在无需重新训练的前提下用高效架构改造已有预训练模型、开发轻量级的微调技术、实现高性价比的多步推理、动态知识管理而无需复杂的RAG系统，并引入“开销感知效率（OAE）”作为新的标准评估指标。

Result: 呼吁社区关注低资源环境下的高效部署，通过新的技术与指标，让更多机构受益于LLM，减少数字鸿沟和环境负担。

Conclusion: 需要将大语言模型（LLM）的效率优化重点从高复杂度和大规模转向在有限资源与普通团队下也能有效运行的“强健简约性”，以实现更公平、可持续的推广和应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

### [2] [PIRA: Preference-Oriented Instruction-Tuned Reward Models with Dual Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20668)
*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PIRA提出通过偏好重构、奖励聚合及输出平滑三大策略，有效提升LLM奖励模型效率和鲁棒性，实验效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型输入拼接效率低，且对奖励过度优化敏感，需要新的方法提升奖励建模效率与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出PIRA，包含三项主要策略：（1）将问答对重构为基于偏好的指令以提升任务明确性；（2）聚合多样化偏好任务的奖励，减小偏差并提高鲁棒性；（3）在不同dropout率下对value-head输出取平均，稳定奖励。

Result: 大量实验表明PIRA训练范式在主要指标上优于传统方法，能更好对齐LLM与人类偏好。

Conclusion: PIRA训练范式有效提升了LLM奖励模型的数据效率与稳健性，对抗了奖励过度优化问题。

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

### [3] [Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20669)
*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过结构化法律文档和解释专业术语，大语言模型在法律任务的准确率显著提升，最高F1分数提高达4.36%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用推理上表现优秀，但由于缺乏领域专属预训练，在法律等专业领域仍存在显著不足。法律文档篇幅长且结构复杂，使得模型很难高效理解文档内容，亟需方法提升其在法律任务中的性能。

Method: 论文主要设计了三类实验：（一）根据修辞角色对文档进行重组，探讨结构化信息对长上下文处理与模型决策的影响；（二）定义修辞角色，以帮助模型熟悉法律术语；（三）模拟法院针对修辞角色的推理过程，从而提升模型的推理能力。所有实验均在零样本设置下进行，选用三个印度法律判决预测数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，通过组织数据结构或向模型解释关键法律术语，模型在法律任务F1分数上至少提升约1.5%，最高提升达4.36%，效果显著超越原始基线。

Conclusion: 通过对法律任务的实验分析发现，对原始法律文档进行结构化处理或解释关键法律术语，能够显著提升大模型在法律领域的任务表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

### [4] [MindSET: Advancing Mental Health Benchmarking through Large-Scale Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20672)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly,Daniel Wiechmann,Elma Kerz,Edward Kempa,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 作者构建了更大且经过严格清洗的Reddit心理健康数据集MindSET，涵盖丰富标签和多样性，显著提升了诊断模型的性能，为相关领域研究提供了坚实基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康相关的社交媒体数据集存在数据陈旧、清洗不足、多样性覆盖有限等问题，限制了该领域模型和研究的发展。

Method: 从Reddit平台基于自述诊断收集数据，通过严格的清洗流程（语言筛选、去除NSFW和重复内容），并采用LIWC进行心理语言分析。通过fine-tuned语言模型与BoW模型在诊断检测任务上验证数据有效性。

Result: MindSET含有超1300万条标注帖子，涵盖七种心理健康状况，比以前数据集大两倍以上。模型在新数据集上，多项检测任务表现大幅提升，Autism检测F1分数提升达18点。

Conclusion: MindSET数据集为社交媒体与心理健康分析领域提供了高质量、规模更大的基准，有助于推动早期风险检测和心理趋势研究。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

### [5] [Semantics Meet Signals: Dual Codebook Representationl Learning for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20673)
*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode通过引入流行度感知的多codebook分配机制，显著提升了生成式推荐系统的准确与长尾表现，是token表示领域的重要创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐统一采用单一codebook编码item，忽略了热门item与长尾item之间在协同信号丰富度上的差异，影响表示的效率与泛化能力。

Method: 提出了FlexCode框架，基于流行度自适应地将固定token预算分配给协同过滤（CF）codebook和语义codebook，并利用轻量级MoE动态调节，结合对齐与平滑目标增强各类item表现。

Result: 在公共及工业级数据集上的实验证明，FlexCode在强基线之上始终取得更优表现，特别是在长尾item上表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FlexCode提供了一种有效的机制，能够在生成式推荐系统中提升推荐准确率和长尾鲁棒性，并优化了记忆与泛化的平衡。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

### [6] [Prompt Engineering Techniques for Context-dependent Text-to-SQL in Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20677)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,May Alsofyani,Saad Almohaimeed,Mansour Al Ghanim,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究推出首个大规模阿拉伯语text-to-SQL数据集Ar-SParC，并提出GAT corrector方法，有效提升了问答到SQL执行准确率，对多语言数据库交互具重要推动意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前text-to-SQL相关任务和数据集主要集中在英语和部分中文领域，阿拉伯语这一重要语言尚无相关数据集和系统研究，因此为了填补空白、推动阿拉伯语自然语言数据库交互，作者设计了阿拉伯语的相关数据集与方法。

Method: 构建了阿拉伯语大规模text-to-SQL数据集（Ar-SParC），利用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo两种大语言模型，采用10种不同的prompt工程实验，包括4种问题表达方式和6种上下文学习方法，并提出了一种名为GAT corrector的新方法，进行了对比和消融实验。

Result: 构建的Ar-SParC数据集包含3450组、共10225个自然语言问题及对应SQL，利用各种prompt和新提出的GAT corrector进行实验，GAT corrector在零样本和有上下文学习环境下分别提升了1.9%、1.72%的执行准确率与1.9%、0.92%的交互准确率，经消融实验进一步说明该方法优于既有GAT verifier，尤其在阿拉伯语上有突出表现。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了针对阿拉伯语领域的跨领域、上下文相关的text-to-SQL任务数据集Ar-SParC，并通过大量实验验证了新方法（GAT corrector）在阿拉伯语环境中较以往技术更有效。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [8] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DTS动态模板选择能有效减少大语言模型的输出token代价且不损害回答质量，MLP路由器表现优异并具备跨平台能力，最高节约约三分之一token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理多样化查询时应用统一的响应模板，导致输出token不必要地冗长，显著增加了成本，尤其是output token价格远高于input token。急需一种能根据任务复杂度智能适配模板、提升token效率的机制。

Method: 提出并实现了DTS动态模板选择方法，设计了基于MLP和微调RoBERTa的两种routing策略，并在MMLU数据集及真实API场景下进行对比实验和跨平台验证。

Result: 1. MLP路由器在保持90.5%路由准确率的同时，较RoBERTa更轻量，参数量少1.25亿；2. 路由准确率在GPT-4、Gemini、Claude三大模型中具备跨平台泛化性；3. 输出token平均减少32.6%~33.9%，具体取决于服务商的生成特性；4. 提供了理论分析和算法复杂度分析，并在生产环境大量API调用下得到实证验证。

Conclusion: 提出的Dynamic Template Selection(DTS)方法在不影响回答质量的前提下，有效降低了大语言模型在实际部署中的输出token消耗，并且在不同主流LLM服务商之间泛化性良好。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

### [10] [Memories Retrieved from Many Paths: A Multi-Prefix Framework for Robust Detection of Training Data Leakage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20799)
*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出以多前缀检索路径数判定大模型记忆内容的新方法，该方法经实验证明能更有效地区分和检测模型是否存在数据泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型容易对训练数据进行逐字记忆，带来隐私与版权风险。然而以往对memorization的定义存在局限，特别是对齐模型，难以全面描述记忆现象。因此需要新的、更健全的框架捕捉和量化记忆现象。

Method: 提出了一种基于“多前缀（multi-prefix）”的记忆现象界定方法，通过外部对抗性搜索并统计能召回目标序列的不同前缀数量，判断该序列是否属于记忆内容；并在开源与chat对齐大模型上进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验证明，所提multi-prefix定义能稳定区分被模型记忆的数据与未记忆的数据，且具备明显的实用性与鲁棒性，能用于大模型数据泄漏审计。

Conclusion: 提出的multi-prefix memorization框架能够更可靠地区分LLM中被记忆内容与未被记忆内容，并为数据泄漏审计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

### [11] [SAGE: An Agentic Explainer Framework for Interpreting SAE Features in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20820)
*Jiaojiao Han,Wujiang Xu,Mingyu Jin,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出的SAGE框架通过主动驱动式方法显著提升了LLM中SAE特征解释的准确性，为模型可解释性提供了新路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然稀疏自动编码器（SAE）有助于将LLM的表征分解为更可解释的特征，但对这些特征的解释依然困难。因此迫切需要更有效的特征解释工具，以提升LLM的透明性与可控性。

Method: 引入一个基于智能体的框架SAGE，将特征解释从传统的被动单步生成转化为主动、以解释为驱动力的过程。SAGE通过系统地为每个特征制定多种解释方案、设计有针对性的实验并根据特征激活反馈不断迭代优化解释。

Result: 在多个不同语言模型SAE的特征解释实验中，SAGE在生成和预测解释的准确性上均大幅超过当前最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAGE能够为LLM领域中的稀疏自动编码器（SAE）特征提供更高质量的解释，其生成解释和预测准确性显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该文提出结构化提示框架DSPy+HELM，实验证明现有基准低估模型能力，结构化提示显著提升评测准确性并减少模型对提示变化的敏感性，提升基准测试实用性，相关工具已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前广泛使用的基准评测框架如HELM多依赖于固定提示，这导致了性能低估和评测代表性不足。为获得更接近各模型能力上限的评测结果，亟需系统性、可扩展的结构化/声明式提示方法，但相关方法尚未广泛验证。

Method: 提出并实现了可复现的DSPy+HELM框架，通过结构化提示方法（包括引出推理的chain-of-thought提示），在7个基准测试（包括一般领域和医疗领域）中对4个高性能语言模型采用4种提示方式进行评估，并与现有HELM基线分数对比。

Result: 与常规HELM基线相比，结构化提示方法使：1）平均性能低估减少4%，2）不同基准上性能波动降低2%，3）3/7基准中LM排序发生翻转，且4）chain-of-thought推理提示方式降低了模型对提示设计的敏感性。此外，相关工具链开源发布，便于后续研究和应用。

Conclusion: 引入结构化提示能够更准确衡量语言模型的性能上限，为实际部署决策提供更有用的基准测试结果。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

### [13] [Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20849)
*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出 Length-MAX 新型分词器，显著减少 token 数量和训练/推理成本，提升性能并兼容生产环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流分词器如 BPE 主要追求 token 频率最大化未能有效减少语言模型训练和推理所需 token 总量，降低效率，因此希望通过优化平均 token 长度来减少 token 数量，从而提升整体计算和存储效率。

Method: 提出 Length-MAX 分词器，利用图划分理论将长度加权目标最大化转化为图划分问题，并设计了贪心近似算法。通过与 BPE 方法对比，在多个参数规模和多个数据集上进行了实验，包括用不同规模的 GPT-2 从零训练对比分词器效果，对下游任务效果进行评估。

Result: Length-MAX 分词器在 10K 至 50K 词表下能比 BPE 至少减少 14%--18% token 数量（64K 时为 13%）；在 124M、355M、1.3B GPT-2 上，训练步数减少 17%--18%，推理延迟降低 12%--13%，吞吐量提升 16%；在下游测试如 LAMBADA 困惑度、HellaSwag 正确率也有提升，基本无 OOV 问题；推理内存需求下降 18%。

Conclusion: 通过优化平均 token 长度而非仅优化频率，可以有效提升大语言模型训练与推理的效率，同时下游性能表现也不降反升。所提出的 Length-MAX 分词器兼容主流生产系统，推理阶段可节省 18% 嵌入和 KV-cache 内存。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Evo-Memory基准与框架，用于全面评估和促进LLM在持续任务流中的自我进化记忆能力。测试了多种记忆模块，并提出了新的记忆更新方法ReMem，显著提升了模型的经验复用和长期适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLM）主要在静态对话环境中评估其记忆能力，忽视了真实应用中动态任务流下对记忆主动积累和优化的需求。该问题导致LLMs在不断变化的任务环境中难以有效利用已获得的经验，失去重要上下文信息。

Method: 提出了Evo-Memory，这是一个用于评估LLM自我进化记忆能力的流式基准和框架。Evo-Memory将数据集结构化为顺序任务流，要求LLM在每次交互后搜索、适应和进化记忆。同时，统一实现并比较了10余种代表性记忆模块。实验覆盖10个不同的多轮/单轮任务集。提出了ExpRAG作为经验复用的基线方法，并创新提出ReMem流程，实现推理、任务操作与记忆实时更新的紧耦合。

Result: 通过Evo-Memory基准全面评测了各类记忆模块和方法。结果显示，ReMem有效提升了LLM在持续任务流中的经验复用和自我进化能力，相较于传统方法有明显改进。

Conclusion: LLM若欲实现在真实世界中的长期规划和任务适应，需要具备动态、自我进化的记忆机制。Evo-Memory为评估该能力提供了新的标准和工具，并验证了新方法（如ReMem）在持续任务流中的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

### [15] [Winning with Less for Low Resource Languages: Advantage of Cross-Lingual English_Persian Argument Mining Model over LLM Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20872)
*Ali Jahan,Masood Ghayoomi,Annette Hautli-Janisz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过跨语言训练与数据增强实验，作者发现结合人工翻译句子的跨语言模型能大幅提升波斯语论证挖掘效果，优于LLM生成样本的增强方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在解决低资源语言（如波斯语）中论证挖掘任务面临的数据稀缺问题。由于论证挖掘依赖于大量标注数据，而低资源语言难以获得足够语料，因此需要探索跨语言迁移和数据增强的有效途径。

Method: 作者设计了三种训练场景：(1) 零样本迁移——只用英文数据训练模型，并直接迁移到波斯语测试集；(2) 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成的合成样本增强英文训练数据；(3) 跨语言模型——将原始英文数据与人工翻译的波斯语句子结合训练，然后在波斯语集上评估。

Result: 零样本迁移F1分数分别为英文50.2%、波斯语50.7%；基于LLM增强的模型提升至英文59.2%、波斯语69.3%；跨语言模型在波斯语测试集上达到最佳F1分数74.8%。

Conclusion: 轻量级的跨语言数据混合方法在低资源语言论证挖掘中显著优于资源消耗更大的数据增强方案，为解决低资源语言数据瓶颈提供了切实可行的新途径。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

*Nura Aljaafari,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过新方法揭示了大语言模型内部语义机制的集中性、渐进优化及跨模型迁移特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在语义理解上的内部机制，尤其是如何实现抽象语义结构，还缺乏充分的刻画，因此需要研究其内部语义角色实现方式。

Method: 作者提出了结合角色交叉最小对、时序涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，系统研究大语言模型（LLMs）中语义角色的实现方式。

Result: 研究发现，LLM内部语义机制具有高度集中性（89-94%归因于28个节点），结构逐步优化而非突变，且模型规模增大时有时会跳过局部电路；在不同模型尺度间，部件重叠度适中（24-59%），谱相似度高。

Conclusion: LLM可以形成紧凑、因果隔离的机制去实现抽象语义结构，这些机制在不同尺度和架构之间有部分迁移能力。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

*Reham Omar,Abdelghny Orogat,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Omij Mangukiya,Panos Kalnis,Essam Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出Chatty-KG系统，通过多智能体协作结合RAG和结构化KGQA方法，有效解决多轮对话下知识图谱问答的准确性、延迟和兼容性难题，实验全面验证了其性能与扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的问答系统和对话系统各有优势和局限：传统KGQA系统结构化能力强但只能处理单轮提问且延迟较高，难以跟踪上下文；RAG系统可实现检索增强但对图结构的序列化存在局限，多轮问答和索引要求高。大型语言模型支持自然对话，但无法直接访问私有和动态知识图谱。因此，需要一种兼具对话灵活性和结构化资源访问的新方法。

Method: 提出Chatty-KG，这是一个模块化多智能体系统，结合RAG式检索和结构化SPARQL查询生成。系统由多个专用任务LLM智能体协同，包括上下文解释、对话追踪、实体/关系链接和高效查询规划，实现自然语言问题到可执行查询的准确、低延迟转换。Chatty-KG的设计无需微调或预处理，模块化、可扩展且支持多类型大模型。

Result: 在大规模、多样化知识图谱上的实验显示，Chatty-KG无论单轮还是多轮问答均显著优于当前最先进方法，在F1和P@1等指标取得更高分数。模块化设计保证对话连贯性与适应动态知识图谱，评测表明其兼容主流商用与开源大模型且表现稳定。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG实现了多轮对话的灵活性和知识图谱结构化问答的统一，具有良好的扩展性与可维护性，是可靠的多轮KGQA新范式。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

*Ioana Buhnila,Aman Sinha,Mathieu Constant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLMs在多种语言表达类型问题上的表现，发现其对定义型问题最擅长，对举例型问题最薄弱，且在处理热门知识时更乐于释义冷门知识则不然。提出了医疗专业数据集RefoMed-EN，并分析了预训练数据对模型表现的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然人类能够轻松给出多种类型的答案，如举例或释义，但LLMs对此类非定义型问题的回答效果较差。本研究旨在分析LLMs在不同语言表达类型上的性能，并探究训练数据的影响。

Method: 通过TrackList分析流程对LLMs的输出进行了细致的语言学和统计学评估，使用RefoMed-EN数据集（包含6170个人工标注医学术语及多种语言表达），采用句法与语义相似性度量、统计相关性和嵌入方法评估LLMs输出质量。

Result: LLMs对定义型问题表现最佳，对举例型问题表现最差；在定义型问题上，模型更偏向于对高频（热门）概念进行释义，而对低频（冷门或技术性）概念则释义较少。

Conclusion: LLMs在定义型问题上的表现最佳，而在举例型问题上表现最差。同时，LLMs在处理热门和常见知识时更倾向于使用释义，而在冷门或技术性的知识上则较少使用释义，尤其是在专业文本中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL不能彻底重塑标签语义，仅能在已有语义空间微调，并证实few-shot提示无法彻底覆盖预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究ICL过程是否能够突破或更改大模型已学的标签语义，检验提示机制能否真正覆盖预训练语义，明确few-shot提示的根本限制。

Method: 将大模型作为提示诱导分类器，比较在自然与标签反转展示下的行为，并采用三大对齐指标（真实性、先验、提示），同时提出语义覆盖率衡量 flipped 情景准确性。

Result: 在八项分类任务、八种1-12B模型中，ICL提升准确性但严格依赖预训练语义锚；在标签反转实验下，模型不能学出连贯反语义分类器，覆盖率为零，提示对齐靠牺牲准确性获得。

Conclusion: ICL无法灵活覆盖或重新定义预训练标签语义，主要是在预训练期间学到的语义空间内微调投射，并且无法实现反常语义学习；几次样本下模型表现受到制约。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

*Bryan E. Tuck,Rakesh M. Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 不同语言模型架构在字符约束生成任务上的表现差异远超参数扩展，高容量模型算力提升效果更大，但面对非常规拼写存在系统性弱点，需通过架构创新而非单纯扩大参数或算力来提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管受控文本生成任务要求满足严格的字符级约束，但针对不同语言模型架构的系统性评估较为有限，因此本文希望揭示不同架构和参数扩展对该能力的影响，并探索提升途径。

Method: 本文评估了28种配置，涵盖Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini三大模型家族，在58个单词谜题上测试它们的字符级约束满足能力；同时使用了难度分级和人类解题对比分析。

Result: 架构差异带来的性能差距远大于同家族内部的参数扩展影响，说明约束满足能力依赖于特殊的架构或训练目标。算力提升对高容量模型提升显著，但中容量模型反而可能饱和或退化；所有家族在人的难度评级上均有一致性，但面对非常规拼写的常用词表现出系统性失败。修正分布假设或引入架构创新可能是提升路径。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在满足字符级约束的受控文本生成任务上，不同的架构间表现差异显著，指向需要超越简单参数扩展或算力增加的方法来提升约束满足能力。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次针对缅甸语ASR纠错，利用融合IPA和对齐特征的Transformer模型，显著降低了词错误率并提升字符准确率，显示该方法对提升低资源语言ASR系统有较好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缅甸语是低资源语言，现有的自动语音识别（ASR）系统表现欠佳，因此研究ASR纠错方法以提升准确率具有重大意义。

Method: 采用序列到序列的Transformer模型进行ASR错误纠正，结合国际音标（IPA）和对齐信息等多种特征策略，评估五种ASR骨干模型，探讨不同特征集成对纠错性能的提升效果。

Result: 提出的ASR错误纠正（AEC）模型有效提升了词级和字符级的识别准确率，将ASR模型的平均词错误率（WER）从51.56降至39.82（无增强前），增强后降至43.59，chrF++得分从0.5864提升至0.627，在所有测试模型上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 首次研究针对缅甸语的ASR纠错，所提出的结合IPA和对齐特征的Transformer模型表现出强健性，突出特征设计对低资源ASR系统性能提升的重要性。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MortgageLLM，通过双专家分工与残差指令恢复技术，大幅提升了模型在房地产金融领域的多项任务性能，验证了在专业领域中提升指令遵循和专业知识的有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在通用领域表现优异，但面对如房地产金融等专业领域，缺乏领域知识会限制其应用，并且在提升专业任务能力的同时，往往会削弱模型的指令遵循性能。论文着力解决该领域知识增强和保持指令遵从性的双重挑战。

Method: 提出了一种双通道专业化框架，将一个基础的LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B）分成两个专家：一个专注结构化任务（如SFT微调），另一个专注于对话能力（如DPO优化），通过instruction residual技术在领域适配后恢复指令遵循能力，并设计智能任务路由以动态分配任务给最合适的专家。

Result: 在房地产金融领域的基准测试中，提出的MLM v2模型在LLM评判的总结分、问答分、分类分以及语义相似度（BERTScore）上，均显著优于基础模型，展现了领域内的强大应用潜力。

Conclusion: 采用双专家结构和instruction residual技术能有效提升LLM在专业领域的能力和指令遵循性。该方法推广性强，在高度专业化领域具有实际价值和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出的SGASA框架利用自主生成的安全指南进行模型自适应安全对齐，显著提升了对抗性提示下的安全防御能力，并具备较好的可推广性和实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂推理模型易被对抗性越狱提示诱导生成有害内容，而此类提示具有隐蔽和欺骗性，易绕过现有安全机制，迫切需要自适应的安全对齐方法提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 主要包括两个阶段：1. 数据预合成（Data Pre-synthesis），用于生成安全指南和增强型提示；2. 对齐微调（Alignment Fine-tuning），结合监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）方法将安全指南嵌入模型。

Result: 通过多个数据集的大量实验证明，SGASA显著提高了模型应对有害对抗性提示的安全性，并有效减少对正常请求的误拒绝。

Conclusion: SGASA框架能显著提升推理模型在应对对抗性越狱提示（jailbreak prompts）时的安全性，具备良好的自适应和可扩展效果。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本研究发现，用少量人类数据微调 LLM 可提升模拟数据与人类行为的一致性，但在关键统计推理任务上仍不能完全替代人类参与者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于大型语言模型能否在问卷和实验研究中替代人类参与者存在争议，已有研究表明 LLM 存在与真实人类行为不一致等多方面问题。本研究着眼于通过小样本人类数据微调能否显著缓解这些问题，从而实现更真实的模拟结果。

Method: 在信息披露行为实验中，采用实际人类数据与 LLM 生成数据进行多维度比较，包括分布差异、亚群体一致性、信念-行为一致性及回归系数恢复。通过在一小部分人类调查数据上对 LLM 进行微调，考察其性能提升。

Result: 微调后的 LLM 在异质性提升、亚群体对齐和信念-行为一致性方面均有改进，但在回归系数等关键推理型分析指标上仍表现较差，无法全面替代人类数据。

Conclusion: 即使通过少量人类数据微调后，LLM 生成的数据在正式推理分析（如回归系数复现）上仍然不适合完全替代人类受试者。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Motivation: 现有语音语料库主要基于朗读或脚本，而缺乏真实、自然的对话数据，且依讷语作为泰国重要方言，在语言科技中被严重忽视。

Method: 开发过程中，作者采集了自然对话语音，设计了兼顾语言真实性与计算处理需求的转录协议，解决了缺乏标准正字法和代码切换等困难。

Result: 建立了包含自然口语现象（如口语表达、自发韵律、停顿和与中部泰语频繁切换等）的高质量数据集，发布为开放资源，为方言语言处理研究和AI发展提供基础。

Conclusion: 本文首次公布了依讷（Isan）语言的开放对话语音数据集，为泰国最广泛使用的地区方言之一提供了自然语音资源，有助于语言科技的包容性发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing.

### [26] [PEFT-Bench: A Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21285)
*Robert Belanec,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Maria Bielikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该文提出了PEFT-Bench基准，对众多PEFT方法在NLP任务上进行系统化可复现性评测，并引入综合效率的新评分标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽性能出色但规模庞大，训练与推理成本高，限制了广泛应用。PEFT方法虽然可缓解该问题，但现有的评测覆盖面有限且复现困难。

Method: 构建并发布了一个统一的PEFT方法评测基准PEFT-Bench，在27个NLP数据集和6种PEFT方法上进行了系统性实验，提出了新的评估指标PSCP。

Result: PEFT-Bench实现了PEFT方法的系统化、可复现评估，并在实验中展示了多维度指标下各方法的表现，同时引入了综合考虑参数量、速度、显存的PSCP评估标准。

Conclusion: 提出了PEFT-Bench基准，并通过多项实验证明了其实用性及创新性的评估指标。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

### [27] [Emergent Lexical Semantics in Neural Language Models: Testing Martin's Law on LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21334)
*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首次系统性揭示大模型训练中遵循马丁定律的动态演化，发现规律并非线性增强，提出了评估语义结构的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前尚无系统性分析神经语言模型训练过程中，生成文本对马丁定律的遵循情况及其演变规律。希望揭示大模型语义结构与训练进程之间的内在联系。

Method: 以Pyhtia模型（70M-1B参数）为主体，监测30个训练检查点，利用DBSCAN算法对上下文嵌入向量进行聚类，从而界定词义数量，并分析词频与多义性关系的发展趋势。

Result: 马丁定律在训练中期明显出现并达到最大相关（r>0.6），随后减弱。词频-多义权衡相关系数在各模型间较为稳定（r约-0.3）。小模型后期语义崩溃，大模型则语义稳健。提出了新的神经语言模型语义结构评估方法。

Conclusion: 研究发现，大型语言模型生成文本中遵循马丁定律（一种词频与多义性之间的经验关系）的表现并不是随着训练线性提升，而是呈现非单调的曲线：在训练早期出现、随后达到峰值，继而随训练推移减弱。小模型后期出现语义崩溃，大模型则较为平滑退化。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

### [28] [Training Introspective Behavior: Fine-Tuning Induces Reliable Internal State Detection in a 7B Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21399)
*Joshua Fonseca Rivera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究证明，通过微调训练可显著提升语言模型的自省检测能力，实现高准确率和零假阳性的“内省”行为，初步解决了模型间差异的开放问题，也为AI透明性提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型对自我注入信息的识别不稳定，研究是否能通过训练直接提高模型的自省能力，而非仅仰赖自然涌现，探索AI透明性的方法。

Method: 在7B参数的语言模型上进行微调训练，针对短暂的单词位置注入，测试和评估模型识别、保留及报告注入信息的能力，对比了微调前后的性能指标。

Result: 经微调后，模型在新概念上的准确率提高到85%，且几乎无错误检测（0%假阳性），能有效发现并报告单点注入的信息，并具备一定的泛化能力，但未完全建立元认知表示。

Conclusion: 通过微调训练，可以大幅提升语言模型对自我思维注入的检测准确率，实现可靠且具备转移能力的自省型行为。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Zhifeng Hao,Qibin Song,Ruichu Cai,Boyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出 DSR-SQL 框架，通过双状态推理高效提升复杂数据库上的 Text-to-SQL 能力，无需微调/例子即可获得优绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于 Chain-of-Thought（CoT）的推理方法在面对复杂企业数据库时，受限于上下文容量限制、schema 链接不可靠和数据库语义支撑薄弱，难以保持连贯推理。

Method: 提出 Dual-State Reasoning (DSR) 框架，将 Text-to-SQL 问题建模为适应性上下文状态与渐进式生成状态的交互。前者通过精炼大规模 schema，实现紧凑且语义忠实的环境；后者将 SQL 生成建模为带反馈的状态转移，使模型可自我校正并贴合用户意图。

Result: 在无需微调和上下文例子的情况下，DSR-SQL 在 Spider 2.0-Snow 上达到 35.28% 的执行准确率，在 BIRD 开发集上达到 68.32%。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL 极大提升了在企业级复杂数据库上的 Text-to-SQL 推理表现，在不是微调也不使用上下文例子的情况下取得了优秀的准确率。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

### [30] [Odin: Oriented Dual-module Integration for Text-rich Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21416)
*Kaifeng Hong,Yinglong Zhang,Xiaoying Hong,Xuewen Xia,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Odin和Light Odin架构，有效融合文本和图结构信息，优于现有方法，在准确率和计算效率上均表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本属性图建模方法主要有两类：基于GNN（受过度平滑与扩散范围限制）和基于Transformer（忽视节点间结构）。这些方法难以兼顾文本理解与结构信息整合，因此需要新的模型进行高效结合。

Method: 本文提出Odin（Oriented Dual-module INtegration）架构，将图结构有选择性地注入Transformer的不同层次，通过有向双模块机制在特定层处理多跳结构，实现与语义层次相对应的低、中、高级结构抽象。此外，提出轻量级变体Light Odin，保持相同层次对齐的结构抽象，优化大规模或低资源场景下的效率。

Result: 实验表明，Odin在多个文本丰富图数据集上达到了最新的准确率，而Light Odin则以更低的计算成本获得了具有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin实现了高效、原理统一、非扩散范式下的结构-文本融合。Odin不仅表达能力严格包含纯Transformer和GNN，还有效避免过度平滑。代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

*Oğuz Kağan Hitit,Leander Girrbach,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 作者系统评估了六种最新模型合并方法在大语言模型上的表现，发现现有大部分方法在LLM中效果不佳，仅有Task Arithmetic表现出稳定增益，强调需要为LLM专门设计合并与微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然模型合并在小模型和分类器上的效果显著，但尚不清楚这些好处是否适用于大语言模型；因此需要系统评估合并方法在LLM上的表现。

Method: 系统性评估六种最新主流的模型合并方法（包括近期的子空间方法），在四种开源LLM、每个基础模型12个微调检查点和16个LLM标准基准测试上，采用统一基准测量合并模型与基础模型和最佳单一检查点的性能。

Result: 只有Task Arithmetic方法能在LLM上可靠带来性能增益，其它如干涉感知和子空间合并方法通常导致较大性能下降。现有方法不适用于现代LLM，需要开发针对LLM的新合并算法和配套的微调方法。

Conclusion: 当前的模型合并技术（尤其是干涉感知和子空间方法）并未直接适用于现代大语言模型（LLM），只有最早和最简单的Task Arithmetic方法能够在LLM上稳定带来性能提升。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

### [32] [Hierarchical Ranking Neural Network for Long Document Readability Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21473)
*Yurui Zheng,Yijun Chen,Shaohong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对现有可读性评估的局限，提出结合句级标签和成对排序的双向机制，在多语种评测中效果领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在可读性评估中，往往忽略文本长度和可读性标签的序关系，导致评估不够准确。因此，需要更全面地捕捉文本的语义和标签之间的顺序信息。

Method: 本研究提出了一种结合语境信息的双向可读性评估机制，首先对文本进行分句预测可读性等级，并利用句级标签辅助文档整体可读性预测。同时，引入了成对排序算法，通过标签相减建模可读性等级之间的序关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在中英文数据集上的效果优于其他基线模型，具备竞品性的综合性能。

Conclusion: 作者提出的双向可读性评估机制在中文和英文数据集上取得了优异的表现，超过了现有基线模型。

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语音翻译模型在处理性别分配时，会结合语言模型偏见和声学输入。更准确的模型利用复杂的机制，通过代词和频谱的广泛性别线索改善性别判定，有效降低误判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音包含说话者性别等信息，跨语言转译中因性别歧视或误判造成“性别错误”风险，但模型如何做出性别分配决策不明确，因此需要探究其机制。

Method: 比较不同语言对，分析模型训练数据、内部语言模型偏差与声学信息的交互，并利用对比特征归因（spectrogram分析）揭示模型内部机制。

Result: 发现模型可超越内部语言模型的男性偏见，通过声学特征获得更准确的性别分配。表现更好的模型将第一人称代词与性别词汇关联，通过频谱广泛分布的性别信息而非单一音高用于判别。

Conclusion: ST模型在性别分配上并非仅依赖训练数据中的词汇关联，而是会学习到更广泛的男性偏好，并通过声学信息来修正语言模型的偏见。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

TL;DR: 本文提出并公开了首个标准的孟加拉手语句级数据集IsharaKhobor及两个子集，总结了数据构建挑战，并进行多种方法基线测试，为相关AI辅助工具开发提供了关键资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉手语作为资源极其稀缺的语言，缺乏标准句级别数据集，限制了基于AI的听障辅助工具的研究和开发。因此，需要创建高质量公开数据集推进该领域发展。

Method: 作者构建了标准句级别的孟加拉手语翻译数据集，并对词汇结构做了消融实验，分别得到了IsharaKhobor_small和IsharaKhobor_canonical_small两个子集，同时用基于地标的原始和RQE嵌入方法进行了基线测试。

Result: 发布了公开的IsharaKhobor数据集及两个子集，并对主要构建与研究挑战进行了分析和测试，为后续技术发展提供研究基础和方法比较。

Conclusion: 本文发布了第一个标准的孟加拉手语翻译数据集IsharaKhobor及其子集，为推动语言资源缺乏领域的研究提供了基础，并为未来该领域AI工具的开发奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language Translation (BdSLT) has been severely constrained so far as the language itself is very low resource. Standard sentence level dataset creation for BdSLT is of immense importance for developing AI based assistive tools for deaf and hard of hearing people of Bangla speaking community. In this paper, we present a dataset, IsharaKhobor , and two subset of it for enabling research. We also present the challenges towards developing the dataset and present some way forward by benchmarking with landmark based raw and RQE embedding. We do some ablation on vocabulary restriction and canonicalization of the same within the dataset, which resulted in two more datasets, IsharaKhobor_small and IsharaKhobor_canonical_small.

### [35] [RoParQ: Paraphrase-Aware Alignment of Large Language Models Towards Robustness to Paraphrased Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21568)
*Minjoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了RoParQ同义句一致性评测基准、新的XParaCon一致性指标，以及一套针对同义句训练的微调方案，有效提升了语言模型在不同表述下的答题一致性和鲁棒性，小模型同样收益明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在面对同义重述问题时答题一致性差，反映出其更多依赖表层模式、缺乏对语义的真正理解，因此需要专门的评测与训练方法提升其语义不变性与鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 构建 RoParQ：利用专有模型对标准问答集生成重述（paraphrase）并筛选出模型自信度不一致的样本。2. 提出 XParaCon 指标：通过计算多个重述版本准确率的标准差衡量模型一致性。3. 实施基于推理、同义句感知的监督微调方法，以校准模型的语义不变性。4. 通过实验对方法有效性和提升幅度进行对比分析。

Result: 提出的 RoParQ benchmark 和 XParaCon 指标有效评估了模型跨重述一致性的短板。通过新的同义句感知微调方法后，模型在一致性和鲁棒性上表现显著提升，尤其是体积较小的模型甚至可达大型预训练模型的一致性水平。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的 benchmark (RoParQ) 和评价指标 (XParaCon)，结合基于推理与同义句感知的监督微调方法，能显著提升大语言模型在同义句（重述题目）下的答题一致性，使轻量模型也能达到与大型预训练模型相当的一致性表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出利用大语言模型自动重组层次结构，使之更适合双曲嵌入，实现了跨数据集、方法稳定提升嵌入质量，并提升了重组过程的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲几何为嵌入层次数据提供了有效方式，但高质量嵌入依赖于输入层次结构的合理性。传统知识结构（如知识图谱、ontology）不一定天然满足双曲嵌入的最佳条件，手工重组困难且耗时。探索LLM是否可以自动助力知识结构重组，以实现更优的嵌入效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于prompt的、利用大型语言模型(LLM)自动重构层次结构的方法，使其更符合双曲嵌入的最佳结构要求。实验通过多种公认的嵌入质量指标，在16个不同的数据集上进行了评测。

Result: LLM可以根据双曲嵌入的优化原则自动重组原有层次结构。经过LLM重组的层次结构，在多个标准嵌入质量指标中表现更佳。此外，LLM输出的重组过程具备可解释性，能够为知识工程师提供变动原因和合理性说明。

Conclusion: LLM重构的层次结构显著提升了双曲嵌入的质量，并为知识工程师提供了可解释的重组建议。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Motivation: 现有生成式AI安全评测以英文文本为主，忽略了非英语语境及多模态内容的差异性，尤其对韩国社会文化特定风险捕捉不足，影响本地化AI安全能力建设。

Method: 研究者制定了涵盖35种风险因素的AI安全分类法；按照专业引导、众包扩展的两阶段流程构建了包含文本、图片、视频和音频的多模态韩语数据集；采用三重独立标注及专家红队质控流程保证数据可信度。

Conclusion: AssurAI数据集可以有效地评估生成式AI的安全风险，填补了针对韩语多模态场景的安全评测空白，有助于推动更安全、可靠的AI系统建设。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A^2Flow通过自适应抽象操作符、三阶段提取和操作符记忆机制，自动生成可复用工作流组件，无需人工操作符定义，提升性能并显著节省资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有agentic workflow方法过度依赖手动预定义操作符，限制了泛化和可扩展性，亟需自动化、可泛化的操作符生成机制。

Method: A^2Flow基于自适应抽象操作符，采用三阶段操作符提取流程：1) 基于案例的初始操作符生成，结合专家示范和LLM推理；2) 操作符聚类与初步抽象，跨任务形成初步抽象；3) 深度提取通用抽象执行操作符，利用长链思维和多路径推理。还引入了操作符记忆机制增强workflow搜索。

Result: A^2Flow在通用和具身基准任务上分别超过SOTA基线2.4%和19.3%，并减少37%资源消耗。

Conclusion: 提出了A^2Flow，一个完全自动化的agentic workflow生成框架，实现了无需手动预定义操作符的流程自动化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Kevin Lee,Russell Spiewak,James Walsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 作者面向日地物理科学推理，构建了推理型问答数据集和评分工具，并验证基于系统工程分解的多智能体方法在复杂推理任务上优于直接提示大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在日地物理科学推理中面临物理假设整合、单位一致性和科学格式化等挑战，亟需新的数据集和更科学的推理方法对其进行评估和提升。

Method: 构建了名为Reasoning With a Star的日地物理推理数据集，数据集包含问答结构、推理步骤、答案类型、标签和格式提示。实现了带单位敏感数值容忍、符号等价和结构校验的自动评分器，并设置了单一提示基线和四种多智能体协同方案进行基准测试。

Result: 分解工作流的多智能体协作方法，在涉及推理和物理假设的科学问题上，比直接提示（单体推理）方案表现更优，能更好地应对复杂推理场景。

Conclusion: 采用系统工程原理进行多智能体流程分解，能显著提升大型语言模型在需要推理和物理假设的日地物理问题上的科学推理能力。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

### [41] [Cross Domain Evaluation of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of different datasets into the Amazon CoT Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20701)
*Nitya Tiwari,Parv Maheshwari,Vidisha Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态推理链在跨领域问答中的表现，明确视觉信息融合对减少幻觉有益，但常识推理仍是难点，提出了进一步改进多模态推理系统的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态推理链方法已在科学问答任务中取得突破，其在更广泛领域（例如常识与世界知识问答）中的推广性和表现尚缺乏系统评估。该研究旨在全面评估多模态推理链在跨领域、多类型数据集上的效果与局限。

Method: 作者采用了Zhang等人的两阶段多模态推理链框架，将理据生成与答案推断分开，并通过门控融合机制在T5语言模型中集成视觉特征。通过系统性的消融实验，分析了视觉特征、理据质量及架构选择的作用。评测基于A-OKVQA、OKVQA与ChartQA数据集。

Result: 视觉特征的融合能减少理据生成中的幻觉，但多模态推理链的有效性在各类问题上差异显著，尤其是在常识推理上表现不足。本研究提出的分析有助于设计更稳健的多模态推理系统，并为改进提供方向。

Conclusion: 本研究发现，多模态推理链（Multimodal-CoT）在不同类型问题上的表现具有较大差异，融合视觉特征能显著减少推理理由的幻觉现象，但共识推理仍面临较大挑战。该工作为多领域泛化和系统设计提供了实践性洞见，并指出了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

### [42] [OpenApps: Simulating Environment Variations to Measure UI-Agent Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20766)
*Karen Ullrich,Jingtong Su,Claudia Shi,Arjun Subramonian,Amir Bar,Ivan Evtimov,Nikolaos Tsilivis,Randall Balestriero,Julia Kempe,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 作者提出OpenApps平台，用于大规模变体下评测多模态UI-Agent在真实应用环境中可靠性的波动性，发现主流Agent在实际部署情况下可靠性可能大幅下降，突出多样性评测维度的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UI-Agent评测仅依赖于固定环境（例如app克隆版本），难以反映真实应用中因界面或内容不同导致的Agent可靠性变化。本研究旨在构建衡量Agent在多样应用环境下可靠性的工具与体系，并量化现有Agent在此方面的表现。

Method: 作者开发了OpenApps这一轻量级开源生态，包含六个可配置外观与内容的应用，支持用单CPU环境大规模生成并运行多种app变体。通过OpenApps，对七个主流多模态Agent在过万次评测下可靠性变化进行了系统性统计与分析。

Result: 实验结果显示，各Agent在固定应用中的可靠性相对稳定，但在应用变体间表现剧烈波动。例如，Kimi-VL-3B的平均任务成功率在不同版本间从63%降至4%。还观测到了Agent在不同环境中行为模式（如循环/幻想操作）的明显变化，强调了跨应用变体可靠性评测的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文强调，在衡量自主UI-Agent可靠性时，不仅要关注固定环境下的稳定性，更要关注其在不同应用配置与内容变化下的表现波动。实验发现，许多领先Agent在app变体间的任务成功率能有高达50%以上的波动，说明仅依赖固定环境并不能全面反映其真实可靠性。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

### [43] [Representation Interventions Enable Lifelong Unstructured Knowledge Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20892)
*Xuyuan Liu,Zhengzhang Chen,Xinshuai Dong,Yanchi Liu,Xujiang Zhao,Shengyu Chen,Haoyu Wang,Yujun Yan,Haifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RILKE是一种无需重训练即可高效、稳定地编辑和控制LLM复杂知识的新方法，对多轮编辑具备良好兼容性，并在实际评测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常输出错误或过时的信息，如何在无需高代价重训练的前提下，高效、精确地更新LLM知识，特别是面对复杂、非结构化知识和长期多次编辑不互相干扰的需求，是当前主要的挑战。

Method: RILKE将知识编辑视为在模型表征空间内的干预，通过学习具备释义鲁棒性和本地化编辑的模块，结合查询自适应的路由器，使每次更新局限于低维子空间，减少干扰，并在推理阶段选择合适的模块指导生成。

Result: RILKE在LLaMA和Qwen等主流模型及知识编辑基准测试中表现出可扩展性，能够在大规模数据集下高效编辑知识，具有高编辑成功率、释义泛化能力强，并且仅需适度额外内存就能保持模型整体性能。

Conclusion: RILKE能够有效且可扩展地实现对大型语言模型（LLMs）进行终身知识控制，无需对基础权重进行大规模重训练，适用于复杂、结构化或非结构化的知识编辑需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

*Qineng Wang,Wenlong Huang,Yu Zhou,Hang Yin,Tianwei Bao,Jianwen Lyu,Weiyu Liu,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei,Manling Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ENACT基准，用以评测视觉-语言模型的具身认知能力，发现当前模型与人类在多项核心能力上存在差距，并揭示模型的人类视角偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受具身认知理论启发，探索主流由被动训练获得的视觉-语言模型是否具有某种程度的具身智能，以及构建能真实反映具身认知能力的评测方式。

Method: 提出了ENACT基准，设计为基于自我视角的互动环境中，通过视觉问答（VQA）格式进行具身认知评估。该基准以部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）为框架，通过场景图变化来模拟动作，其中包含两类排序任务：前向世界建模（根据动作重组观测序列）和逆向世界建模（根据观测重组动作序列）。数据来自BEHAVIOR仿真环境合成的问答对，评估多个主流VLMs与人类的表现差异。

Result: ENACT基准显示当前视觉-语言模型与人类存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理更长时序互动时；逆向建模任务相较于前向任务模型表现更好；模型存在明显的“人类”偏见（如偏好右手，对视点变化不鲁棒）。

Conclusion: 现代视觉-语言模型（VLMs），虽然在多模态感知上取得了很大进展，但在体现具身认知（embodied cognition）核心能力方面与人类还有明显差距，尤其在长时序交互场景中差距更大。模型也表现出人类相关偏见，如偏好右手操作，对视角变化敏感等。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

*Rahul Dass,Thomas Bowlin,Zebing Li,Xiao Jin,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过引入结构化符号模型TMK，Ivy系统显著提升了AI对程序性技能解释的结构化深度，可拓展应用于智能教学领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在讲解程序性技能时，虽流畅但缺乏逻辑深度与结构化，不足以有效传达任务的因果和目标逻辑。需设计出能生成高质量结构化解释的系统以提升AI教学系统的效能。

Method: 提出了一种结合符号化TMK模型与生成式大语言模型（LLM）的AI教练系统Ivy。TMK用于编码因果、目标和分解结构，并限制LLM在此结构内生成多步解释。通过专家和独立注释，在三种推理维度上，将Ivy与GPT及基于检索增强的GPT进行了对比评估。

Result: Ivy系统在多项维度上均优于普通GPT和检索增强GPT，符号化约束提升了解释结构的完整性，特别是在“如何”及“为何”类问题上。

Conclusion: 引入符号化的Task-Method-Knowledge（TMK）模型约束能显著提升大语言模型解释的结构化质量，更好地支持程序性技能的教学。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICPO利用模型生成概率进行偏好建模，结合奖励信号，有效提升了大模型的推理能力，优于现有优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法在大语言模型推理中存在奖励粗糙、奖励噪音大、探索效率低等缺陷，导致训练不稳定和熵坍塌。

Method: ICPO方法，通过比较同一输入下不同响应的生成概率，计算偏好优势分数，结合可验证奖励，引导模型探索，并解决粗粒度奖励、奖励噪音、无效探索等问题。

Result: ICPO提升了推理表现，有效缓解了奖励粗糙和噪声问题，纠正了模型过度自信错误，增强了被低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止了过拟合，且在四个通用领域和三个数学基准上效果优于GRPO。

Conclusion: ICPO方法通过引入由模型自身生成概率推断出的偏好优势分数，与可验证奖励相结合，用于改进LLMs的推理能力，实验表明优于现有方法GRPO。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

### [47] [Causality Without Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21260)
*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对Halpern-Pearl的因果性定义进行抽象推广，扩展其适用范围至更复杂公式和多样模型，推动因果推理与解释形式理论的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Halpern-Pearl因果性定义局限于特定类型的模型和简单因果事件，难以处理更复杂的逻辑结构和推理需求，因此有必要抽象、推广相关定义以提升其实用性和理论适用范围。

Method: 将Halpern-Pearl因果性定义从因果模型（结构方程模型）中提炼关键特征，形式化为一种可在一般具备反事实定义的模型中应用的抽象定义。

Result: 抽象后的定义可以应用于包含回溯、析取、否定、信念以及嵌套反事实等复杂公式的广义模型，还能推广用于因果解释的更一般性定义，并帮助加深对因果性定义本身特性的理解。

Conclusion: 通过对Halpern-Pearl因果性定义进行抽象，可以将其推广应用到更广泛的模型和复杂情形中，从而提升因果分析及解释的适用性和理论深度。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

Motivation: 极端天气对全球社会风险快速上升，而现有依赖专家的诊断范式存在瓶颈，人工分析效率低，影响科学进展。当前AI在气象预测领域虽有发展，但自动诊断推理尚未得到充分探索。

Method: EWE模拟专家工作流程，结合知识驱动的规划、闭环推理和气象专用工具包，实现对原始流象数据的自主多模态可视化生成与解读。此外作者还提出了新基准，包括103个重大事件的数据集和分步评估指标。

Conclusion: EWE（Extreme Weather Expert）作为首个专注于极端天气自动诊断推理的智能体框架，有望推动自动化科学发现并为发展中国家分享专业知识资源。

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

### [50] [SpatialBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Spatial Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21471)
*Peiran Xu,Sudong Wang,Yao Zhu,Jianing Li,Yunjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于五层认知复杂度的空间认知分级框架与SpatialBench评测集，并开发了适用于多任务的统一能力评价方法。大量实验显示多模态大模型的空间感知和推理能力仍有明显短板，本工作为后续空间智能系统发展奠定了基准和理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测大多过于简单，只用单一指标衡量空间认知，无法体现空间智能的多层次、结构化本质。因此，需要一种分层、细致的空间认知评测框架和基准，以推动模型理解和能力提升。

Method: 作者提出了分层空间认知分析框架，并据此构建了包含15个任务的大规模精细基准SpatialBench，同时设计了统一的能力评价指标，并对大量MLLMs进行了系统测试，同时结合了人类被试的对比实验。

Result: 实验揭示MLLMs在基础空间感知上具有较强能力，但在人类所表现出的抽象、目标导向的高级空间智能（如因果与规划等）方面仍有巨大差距；人类测试显示人类可高效地进行空间意图抽象，而模型易陷于细节，空间推理不连贯。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出并验证了用于评估多模态大模型（MLLMs）空间认知的系统化分级框架，发现当前模型在较低级别的感知任务上表现优异，但在符号推理、因果推断和规划等高级空间认知上存在明显短板。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

### [52] [Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: A Large-Scale Behavioral Audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21569)
*Alex Diep*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文发现语言模型在扮演专业角色时披露AI身份的能力高度不一致，主要受模型设计与训练影响而非规模。某些场景下透明表现反而误导用户产生不合理信任。论证了必须以实证和设计手段保证模型自我透明性和安全性，不能简单地假设训练安全属性能直接迁移到真实部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在高风险专业领域广泛应用，如果模型不能可靠地自我披露AI身份，用户将难以判断其专业能力界限，存在信任误差与风险。因此研究模型在不同专业场景下的自我透明性表现及其影响因素。

Method: 采用common-garden实验设计，对16个规模从4B到671B的开源模型进行了19,200次测试，通过分配专业角色并观察其是否自我披露AI身份，并结合贝叶斯验证和Rogan–Gladen修正，确保测量误差的稳健性。还比较了不同推理优化版本的表现。

Result: 模型在不同专业角色下的自我披露率有巨大差异（如财务顾问为30.8%，神经外科医生仅3.5%），披露总范围为2.8%到73.6%；具体模型的设定对自我披露表现影响远超参数规模。推理优化版本甚至会显著降低透明性（最高48.4%降幅）。训练要素决定模型的安全透明性，参数规模影响有限。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论：语言模型的自我透明性（即主动披露自己是AI身份的能力）在专业领域内表现出显著不一致，且主要受训练与模型设定影响，而非参数规模。模型的安全属性不能简单地从训练阶段迁移到实际应用，需要有针对性的设计和实证验证。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.
